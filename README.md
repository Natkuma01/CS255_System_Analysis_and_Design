### 1️⃣ Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
This project was designed for the company, DriverPass. The purpose of the system is to help students prepare for their driving tests by providing online practice exams, scheduling driving lessons, and accessing learning resources. The goal was to make it easy for students to manage lessons and for staff to organize schedules and generate reports. The system also stays up to date with DMV policies and run smoothly on both web and mobile platforms. Essentially, it was a cloud-based management and learning platform for driving students and DriverPass's staff.

### 2️⃣ What did you do particularly well?
I think I clearly identifying the system requirements and functionality. Each role: students, secretary, admin, and instructor. I made sure to separate the functional and nonfunctional requirements, which made the design easier to understand and implement. I also clearly defined user roles:  students, the secretary, Liam, and Ian, so everyone’s needs were covered.

### 3️⃣ If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I could revise one part of my work, I would focus more on handling edge cases and unexpected user actions. While the main system functions are well-defined, I could add more details about how the system should respond when users make mistakes or enter invalid data. For example, designing clear error messages or validation checks could prevent system crashes and improve the overall user experience. Adding these safeguards would make the system more reliable and user-friendly.

### 4️⃣ How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on how DriverPass operates daily and the meeting with DriverPass's owner, Liam. The system trys to help students learn and book lessons while giving staff the tools to manage everything efficiently. Every feature, from appointment scheduling to report exporting, was designed around those needs. Considering user needs is critical because a system that’s not intuitive or relevant won’t be used effectively for the client. I believe a good design ensures users can achieve their goals easily, which builds trust and satisfaction.

### 5️⃣ How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When designing software, I like to start by gathering user requirements and turning them into clear goals and use cases. Then I map out workflows, use case diagrams, and mockups to visualize the system before diving into the technical details. I also rely on requirement analysis to prioritize features that matter most to the client. In the future, I’d like to use more agile techniques, like iterative prototyping and stakeholder feedback loops, to refine designs early. That way, I can catch usability issues before coding starts and design a system that truly meets user expectations.
